In the Arrival phase, you introduce your players to the start of the mystery by allowing them to explore the aftermath of the hook. In this phase, their Lightkeeper gives them additional information, NPCs can offer their knowledge or perspective, and clues should reveal themselves, pointing the team in the right direction. As your circle investigates, remember:
the singular piece of critical information, known as the reveal, is the most important clue you must convey to the players, no matter what approach they take.

By focusing your efforts on only one piece of information you must impart, you liberate yourself from attempting to weave the entirety of the mystery into each scene. You can convey a reveal in numerous ways, using a variety of details in any given scene. By deciding what information they will learn, you ensure that you are not withholding too much for the players
to follow the adventure.
