Plan to start the session with something exciting. Try to cut directly into the action: craft the setting, the event, and the characters, then open it up to your players. A hook doesn’t need to be action-packed, but should highlight a pivotal, high-stakes moment. Avoid the “You all meet in the house, what do you do?” method of setting a scene. Instead, think of something that players must immediately address or an event that calls them together. Consider framing this introduction like the start of a TV show or movie—we are getting a preview of the events that occur before our protagonists get involved. In-world, this intro represents the briefing the players receive from Candela Obscura before arriving at the scene.
