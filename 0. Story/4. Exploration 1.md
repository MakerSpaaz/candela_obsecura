In the first Exploration phase, youâ€™ll show the players they are on the right track with their investigation as they follow the first reveal to a new location. Often, this new place is more dangerous than the Arrival and should present evidence that points toward the bigger mystery at hand. The Exploration phase opens up the scope of the mystery, but also (like each
subsequent phase) should utilize a reveal to provide a strong indication of where the players should go next to uncover the truth.
