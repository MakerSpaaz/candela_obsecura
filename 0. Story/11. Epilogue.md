We encourage you to include an epilogue in your adventure. Like the hook, this is a peek into the world when your circle is not around—in this case, after they’ve completed their investigation. This is your opportunity to hint at elements of your next adventure, or include a detail that may become relevant many sessions from now.

Ask yourself specific questions about the way your players tackled this investigation. You may use these as inspiration:
7 Did the circle find every clue you laid for them? If not, why?
7 Did they bond with any NPCs in particular?
7 Did the themes in your adventure resonate with the group?
7 If your party didn’t defeat the adversary in this session, how does this affect the circle
and their future?
7 Did your players reveal any elements of their character’s backstory that you can engage
with in future sessions?
7 How do your players interact with one another at the table, outside of gameplay?

The purpose of the epilogue is to wrap up any loose ends and set you up for success in future sessions of Candela Obscura.
