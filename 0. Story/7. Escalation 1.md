In the first Escalation phase, the story should introduce a twist of some kind—something here isn’t what it seems. That twist should push the players into further danger and direct them toward the climax of the adventure. If things were not already scary, now is the time to start increasing the tension. Put the players in real peril, show them the power of bleed, and remind them of the magickal forces they’re up against.
