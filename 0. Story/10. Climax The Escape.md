In the Climax phase, the drama of the story should reach a crescendo. This is the period of highest tension, where players can experience the most visceral moments of horror. Sometimes, there is a final reveal or twist—something that answers the dramatic question of the mystery in an unexpected or exciting way. Usually, this is the place with the most opportunity for action. During the climax, players sprint for cover, fight the monster, secure the artifact, etc. Think of this as the big ending sequence of a horror movie. Don’t be afraid to introduce the dramatic consequences of failure.
