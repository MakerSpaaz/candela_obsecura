GMs are welcome to establish their own Halen words. If you choose to go this route, we recommend that you draw from your own language and the history and experiences that shaped it. When developing your own vocabulary, remember that respect for real world languages and their speakers builds a safer playing space and encourages bolder exploration of the topics that your group wishes to investigate.
