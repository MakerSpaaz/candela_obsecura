 ###### Mixed Success
On a mixed success, you get what you want, but it comes with a consequence or cost. This is the most common dice result in the game and has the benefit of advancing the story while heightening tension. A mixed success could introduce additional dangers or create complications. For example: you only achieve a portion of your goal, you take marks while performing your action, or your behavior alerts enemies to your circle’s presence. There are any number of consequences that could fit within the narrative while propelling the adventure forward.

>>Remember that you only roll when an action is difficult or dangerous. A Journalist asking an innocent bystander what they saw probably doesn’t require a roll—the potential consequences are low and the Journalist is inherently skilled at what they do. If they’re interrogating a suspect they’ve cornered in an alleyway trying to escape, the dice are likely to come out.

> [!WARNING] On a mixed success, the GM’s move can include:
> **Damage:** You do what you intended, but take some damage in return. This consequence works well when the action you are performing is physically dangerous. You might strike at an enemy with your brass knuckles, but also take Body marks in return.
> 
>** Complications:** You do what you meant to, but there is a side effect. If you’re trying to sneak past someone, and you roll a mixed success, you may get by them, but you leave a trail that they notice, or make a sound that raises their suspicion.
>
> **Concession:** You make it part of the way, but something happens. In a negotiation, you might convince an NPC of the validity of a portion of your argument, but they bring up details that need clarification—or points they won’t budge on. If you’re sneaking, you may make it halfway there before you see an unexpected obstacle. Mixed successes shouldn’t be used when it would completely negate the premise. Meaning: a mixed success from sneaking shouldn’t mean you get caught. This might also manifest as a tough choice you’re forced to make; the GM says you can do one thing or the other thing, but not both.
>
> **Cost:** You do what you set out to do, but there’s a cost involved. You convince the guard to let you inside an area, but only for a limited amount of time. You negotiate an outcome, but the NPC requires a favor from your circle in return. You successfully pick the lock, but it takes longer than you expected.
>
> **Trouble on the Horizon: ** This is an announcement of future problems. It might manifest as noticing footsteps coming around a corner, hearing an approaching creature’s roar, or spotting something that indicates you’re being followed.
>
> **An Opportunity Lost:** An opportunity becomes impossible, or requires more of a commitment than you initially thought you needed to make. You win your scuffle with a minion, only to notice that the person you were after is gone.
>
> **Higher Stakes:** You accomplish your goal, but find yourself in hot water. You’re able to open the ritual gate and shove the demon in, but it takes you with them.


###### Miss
On a miss, the outcome doesn’t go your way—though the GM may, in some limited cases, choose to let you achieve your goal along with a significant consequence. Usually, you won’t achieve your desired outcome, but this shouldn’t always come from character incompetence. Perhaps the enemy was prepared in a way you didn’t anticipate, or the surrounding circumstances were too difficult for you to contend with.

>>If you’re ever facing more powerful opponents, note that the GM might use more than one consequence. This is often reflected in the stakes the GM set for the roll.


> [!WARNING] On a miss, the GM’s move can include:
> Damage: You don’t get what you want, and take significant damage because of it. This consequence works well when the action you are performing is physically dangerous. You try to dodge out of the way of an attack, but it’s unsuccessful and you take a Body mark.
>
> Complications: The goal wasn’t achieved in the way you wanted, and because of that, something happens to further complicate the scene. While sneaking into a suspect’s office, you’ve tripped an alarm or dropped the item you’re holding.
>
>Trouble on the Horizon: Failure to accomplish the objective leads to a discovery of future problems you must face. You don’t get to the door in time to stop the cultist from escaping, and suddenly the ground starts to crack below you. Their ritual worked—a phenomenon is pulling its way into our world.
>
>An Opportunity Lost: A previous opportunity becomes impossible. The escape route now has a new patrol of guards, or an important negotiation doesn’t end in your favor. Higher Stakes: You don’t succeed, and this causes the stakes in the scene to escalate further, putting you in a more dangerous position—the next roll you make will have increasingly dire consequences. Failure means you’re looking down the barrel of a gun.
