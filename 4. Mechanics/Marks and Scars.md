**Marks represent the harm you incur during your investigations.**


> [!NOTE] **There are three different types of marks you may take:**
> Body: Represents physical harm—lacerations from a jagged knife, bites from a creature, broken bones from a fall.
> 
> Brain: Represents mental strain—exhaustion from an intense conversation, anxiety from the fear of being caught, stress from an onslaught of terrifying beasts.
> 
> Bleed: Represents magickal corruption—the chilling touch of a ghost, the venom of a monster, the harmful energy radiating from an artifact.

A character can sustain 3 marks in each of Body, Brain, and Bleed. Whenever you would take a mark in a category that already has 3 marks, you drop incapacitated and take the fourth mark as a scar.

Some gear and abilities allow you to soak a mark. When a mark is soaked, it leaves no damage. If you must take multiple marks, you can soak the amount the gear or ability allows, and still take the rest. You can only heal your marks using Candela Obscura resources between assignments or by using specific abilities or gear.

>> When a PC takes a scar, we encourage the player to look deeply at their character and consider the way they might change throughout the campaign.

A scar represents a permanent change to your character, both mechanically and narratively. Erase all marks in the category you overfilled, then come up with a scar that best reflects the lasting effect of the damage and write it in an available scar slot. Lastly, shift a point from one action rating to another to reflect how the scar changes the way your character interacts with the world. You will be able to return to play when your circle gets you somewhere safe. If your character should take any marks beyond the fourth in a category, those marks are carried over.

###### Example Body Scars

| Event | Scar | Result |
|------|------|------|
| Phenomenon spit acid in face | Blinded | Still learning to move with subtlety, and quick to lash out |
| Arm was crushed by monster | Lost Right Arm | Less aware of their surroundings, eager to prove they’re still capable and strong |
| Pushed from a docking airship | Spinal Injury | Back brace causes slower movement, so they use charmin times of trouble |


###### Example Brain Scars

| Event | Scar | Result |
|------|------|------|
| Failed to save a friend from death | Cannot Sleep | No longer sure they want to be in Candela Obscura, will flee dangerous situations |
| Trapped in a burning building | Fear of Enclosed Spaces | Not as detail-oriented, they look out for future danger | 

>> Scars—especially Brain scars—should be understood as both a mechanical and narrative change to your character and not an opportunity to engage in ableist stereotypes.
>> If a character takes a Brain scar, consider how the traumatic or stressful events they’ve experienced will affect them long-term.


###### Example Bleed Scars

| Event | Scar | Result |
|------|------|------|
| Pulled into a mirror by an apparition | Shifting Appearance | New people cannot remember them, and they can use this characteristic to go undetected |
| Magickal creature burrowed under skin | Body Covered in Mouths| Hands shake when the mouths are hungry, isolate themselves among books|
| Possessed by the spirit of an ancient alchemist| Ghost Trapped within Body | Has trouble communicating with this added voice inside their head, can now channel magickal phenomena| 



>>Due to the legacy of harmful mental health representation in the horror genre, we would like to clarify: Brain marks represent mental and emotional stress. In the same way a week of long workdays, a friend receiving an injury, or witnessing a death (violent or otherwise) would weigh on a person in your world, Candela Obscura members face stressors and traumatic events that impact them beyond the immediate moment.

>> In Candela Obscura, scars are, with few exceptions, **permanent**. The idea of “permanent scars” does not align with the modern understanding of healing trauma. But, just like you, consider that your character cannot begin the process of tending to deep physical, mental, and even magickal trauma until they are in a safe place for an extended period of time. Over the course of a campaign, your circle should experience only brief moments of respite—this is a challenging game of horror.

>[!NOTE] **Healing**
> If you would like to see your character heal from scars they’ve taken, you have options. You may engage with an ally who has taken the Doctor’s ability Lifesaver, the only way to heal scars within the mechanics of the game. You might choose to play a different character for some time and return to this one down the road when they’ve had a chance to recover. Work with your GM to decide which scars they could have healed during this time away.
