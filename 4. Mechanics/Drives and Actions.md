###### Drives and Actions 

In Candela Obscura, three different drives (Nerve, Cunning, and Intuition) encompass the nine actions you can use to overcome the challenges of an assignment. 

Each action has a rating between 0–3 that represents the number of dice you will use when attempting that action. This reflects how well your investigator generally performs this type of behavior under pressure. Actions are covered in more detail starting on page 50.

Each drive has a number of points between 0–9. You can spend any of these available points to add an additional die (+1d) when rolling with an action within that drive. The collection of dice you use for a roll is known as a dice pool. For example, you may spend Nerve to add +1d to a Move roll, or Intuition to add +1d to a Sense roll. Drives are covered in more detail starting on page 48.

All drives have a maximum, which determines the highest number of points your character can have in that drive. They also have an amount currently available, which will decrease as you spend them. When your drive is empty, you cannot spend any more points until you refresh that drive, covered on page 41.

You may also spend drive to assist another investigator in your scene. For more on helping an ally, see page 11.

###### Gilded Dice

Some of your actions will be gilded, denoted by a filled-in diamond. Utilizing this action can help you earn back spent drive points, and narratively represents a skill that reinvigorates your character. When you are rolling with a gilded action, you replace one of your standard dice with a gilded die (a d6 of a different color). If, after you make the roll, you choose the result of the gilded die, you can refresh a point in the drive that encompasses that action. For example, if you take the gilded result on a Survey roll, you earn back 1point in Intuition.

Why wouldn’t you always choose the gilded result? You might roll a 6 on a standard die and a 4 on a gilded die. Instead of taking the full success, you could choose to take a mixed success. You may prefer to recover 1 drive point, sacrificing a cleaner narrative outcome for a mechanical benefit.
