The core dice mechanic of the Illuminated Worlds system is known as an action roll. When there is a question as to whether a move you’re making could succeed or fail and the consequences are important to the narrative, the GM will call for an action roll.


> [!INFO] 
> 1. The GM tells you what action you’ll need to use, along with the stakes and
expectations of the roll. At this time, you may change your approach to adjust
expectations, lower the stakes, or modify the narrative implications.
>
2. You take a number of d6 equal to your action rating and add them to your
dice pool. If the action you are rolling with is gilded, replace one of your dice
with a gilded die.
>
3. If you’d like, you may spend 1 or more points from the drive that action falls
within to add additional dice to the roll.
>
4. Check to see if any of your abilities apply to the situation—these may let you
gild additional dice, add bonus dice, or give you other benefits.
>
5. Roll the final dice pool and tell the GM the highest result. If any of the
dice are gilded, you may take the gilded result, even if it is lower, to earn
back drive points.

The final result will guide the way the narrative unfolds.


> [!INFO] 
> ** On a 1–3 result**, the roll is a failure. Usually, you don’t accomplish what you wanted, and there are consequences.
>
> **On a 4–5 result**, the roll is a mixed success. You accomplish what you wanted, but it comes at a cost.
>
> **On a 6 result**, the roll is a full success. You get what you wanted without complication.
>
> **On multiple 6s**, the roll is a critical success. You get what you wanted, and something extra.



> [!WARNING] Action Rating of Zero
> If you have a rating of zero in the action you need to roll, and you decide not to spend drive to add dice, you can still attempt the action. In that case, you’ll roll two dice and take the lowest result. Note that you can’t get a critical success on this (even if you get two 6s). If you are rolling this way with a gilded action (or if any of your dice are gilded for another reason), you don’t get the opportunity to choose it as your result—but if it is the lowest outcome on the roll, you still earn back drive. Remember that you may always spend drive to add additional dice to a roll, and this can be very helpful on rolls where you have an action rating of zero.


> [!WARNING] Rule of Six
> There is one rule that always applies when making an action roll: you cannot use more than six dice at any time. No matter how many bonus dice you get from assistance, abilities, or drives, you can only ever roll a maximum of six dice in a single action roll.


> [!NOTE] Helping or Making a Group Roll
> You may help an ally on a roll by describing how you aid them in the fiction, and then spending 1 point from your own drive that contains the action they are using. This will give them +1d on the roll. You may not spend more than 1 drive point to add additional dice. By involving your PC in the situation, you are also opening yourself to the dangers of consequences should the roll go poorly.
> 
> When more than one PC wants to help someone with their roll, or multiple members of a circle want to collaborate on one action, a group roll can be made. Choose a PC to lead the attempt—they will use their action rating on the roll, plus any drive they want to spend. Then, any others who are participating may spend 1 drive point to add an additional die to the pool. The roll may not use more than six dice.
> 
>Not all PCs who want to be involved in the group roll must spend drive to do so. The mechanical benefit is only one aspect of their aid—the GM should evaluate how the effectiveness of the action changes based on the contributions of the group, and adjust the expectations of the roll accordingly.


> [!WARNING] Don't be that Person
> When helping an ally, remember that you are offering aid. Use this as an opportunity to support their time in the spotlight rather than overshadowing it.
