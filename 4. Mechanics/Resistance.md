 **For every 3 maximum drive points you have, you also gain 1 point of resistance in that drive.** 
  
Resistance is a character’s way of pushing back against a consequence. Any time you don’t like the result of your roll, you may choose to burn 1 resistance point from the drive related to that action. (Your resistance points are not affected by your drive expenditures, as resistance relies on your maximum drive points, not your current available points.)
 
For example, if you want to resist the consequences of a Control roll, you would burn a Nerve resistance. Even if your Nerve only has 1 current drive point available to spend, if your maximum is 3, you still have that resistance available to burn.

After burning a resistance, you may reroll a number of dice equal to the rating of the action. If you spent drive or were assisted on the previous action roll, those dice are not included in the resistance roll. If that action is gilded, you still roll with a gilded die. If the action you are rerolling has a rating of 0, you roll two dice and take the lowest result. You must take the new result of the resistance roll unless you choose to burn another resistance point to roll again.

>>Kat ducks behind a set of wooden crates, hoping to go unseen by the fiery apparition that is
>>guarding the warehouse. The GM calls for a Hide roll, in which Kat has an action rating of 2.
>>They decide to spend 1 Cunning and roll three dice. The results are two 3s and a 1, all failures.
>>Fearing the repercussions of being spotted, they burn a Cunning resistance to reroll two dice.
>>The results are a 3 and a 6, making the new result a full success.
