 **For every 3 maximum drive points you have, you also gain 1 point of resistance in that drive.** 
  
Resistances are a PC’s way of pushing back against a consequence. Anytime you don’t like the result of your roll, you may choose to spend a resistance from the pertaining drive (Nerve, Cunning, or Intuition). You have 1 resistance per 3 maximum drive. This resistance does not go away if you spend your drive points. For example, if your maximum drive is 4, but you’ve spent 3 drive (so now you have 1), you still have your 1 resistance.

After spending a resistance, you reroll the number of dice equal to the rating of the action used for the previous roll. You may not include the dice from any spent drive or assistance you initially received. If the action is gilded, you may still roll with a gilded die. If the action you are rerolling has a value of 0, you roll two dice and take the lower result. You must accept the result of the new resistance roll unless you spend another resistance to roll again.

>>Kat rolls with Control to see if their character can successfully pick the lock on a door. They have 2 points in this action, and it is gilded. They choose to spend a Nerve drive to add an additional die to their roll. They now roll three dice, one of which is gilded, and choose a result.

>>The two standard dice roll a 3 and a 6. The gilded die rolls a 5.
