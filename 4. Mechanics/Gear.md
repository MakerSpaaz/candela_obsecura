Candela Obscura is primarily focused on the narrative aspects of the game; therefore, gear is not intended to be mechanically complex. It is generally assumed that your character has the tools, equipment, and money to do what they need to do. However, there may be certain objects that are harder to come by or can give your character a distinct edge.

Gear often changes the effectiveness of a roll—meaning: the result might be more successful when you are using gear than it would be without it. A clear example is the difference between rolling Strike while punching with a bare hand versus rolling Strike when wielding a knife.

This can apply across the board to many different situations, such as handling a supernatural specimen with a Bleed Containment Vial as opposed to without one, or quietly breaking into a building using Burglary Tools instead of needing to smash a window.

In some cases, gear may even grant you the ability to roll in a situation where you wouldn’t normally be able to; without climbing gear, you likely couldn’t roll to scale the side of a glass building, and without a map, you likely couldn’t roll to know the way to a hidden location.

Every PC has access to up to **three pieces** of the gear on their character sheet during an assignment, but you don’t have to select these items beforehand. Instead, during play, you may declare that you have a piece of gear that is listed on your character sheet and mark it. This will keep you from having to plan too far ahead and allows your character to be prepared for anything that comes their way. See page 52 for more about gear.
