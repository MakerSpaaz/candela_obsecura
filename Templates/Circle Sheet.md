>> 🔸 **Interdisciplinary:** When choosing a new ability during character advancement, once per campaign, each player may choose an ability from a character role or specialty outside their own.
>> 🔸 **Resource Management:** When your circle hits a milestone on the Illumination track, earn back one Stitch, Refresh, or Train resource.
>> 🔸**One Last Run:** When you select this ability, the next time you fill your Illumination track, your circle will retire from service. Everyone takes all four options during this character advancement.
