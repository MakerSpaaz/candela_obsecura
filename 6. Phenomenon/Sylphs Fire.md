Within a room of the Anatithenai is a large glass vase. It rests uncorked and fills the air with a gaseous fire that burns anything it touches. Those who encounter it suffer violent chemical burns, and the only way to stop its spread is to close the vase. The glass is painted with a line that reads: “Your Flesh for my Fire.” Some suspect the thick smoke is sentient.
