Seemingly a blend of a moth and an eel, these large creatures hang from the cave ceiling over the Endless Descent and pick off anyone who tries to venture down. Though they glide quietly, their cries are said to shatter the soul. Because they have no teeth, these beasts rip their victims apart with their hands, and are known to store the viscera in their gullet until
theyâ€™re hungry.
