![[periphery_badge.jpg|right lp|200]]The police force within the Fairelands is known as the Periphery. In the wake of the Last Great War, the Periphery inherited military technology incongruous with the proclaimed goal of interfacing peacefully with Halen citizens. The Commissioner of the Periphery is appointed by the Premier, just as the region’s judiciary is appointed by members of the Chamber. This means that the justice system in this portion of Hale is created and enforced through the influence of politicians. 

Coming out of the Last Great War, the Fairelands are gaining a reputation for having a violent, militarized police force—a reality that many former soldiers who fought to protect civilians openly oppose. Officers in the Periphery have been known to overzealously police citizens and use almost any excuse to arrest and lock them away in jail cells around the city. 

There is a growing resentment between those who fought in the Last Great War and the up-and-coming members of the Newfairen police force. This results in clashes with the Periphery, who are known to prioritize protecting one another over protecting the citizens of Newfaire and the Fairelands region.
