The Primacy is the regional government of the Fairelands and is led by an elected official known as the Premier. Members of the Fairelands Chamber, known as chamberlains, work beneath the Premier to make decisions for the region. The Premier wields absolute executive authority within their territory. Unless otherwise directed by the Prime Minister of Hale, the Premier also acts as the commander in chief of regional military forces in times of war. Additionally, Premiers serve as legislative members within the Halen Assembly, coming together to make decisions for the country as a whole. The current Premier, [[Remedy Mallingson]], is in her second and last term of office. Though she is considered a tough leader who is hard on crime and even harder to negotiate with, she is widely loved for successfully leading the Fairelands through the end of the war and beginning the work of rebuilding the region. The Primacy oversees both the Periphery and the Judiciary within the Fairelands. While the Commissioner of the Periphery and trial judges are supposedly elected by the people, insidious political maneuvering means that candidates are regularly hand-selected by chamberlains to effectively rig elections by providing only Primacy-aligned options.
