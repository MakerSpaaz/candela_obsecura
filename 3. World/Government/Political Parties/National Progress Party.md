In opposition to the Patriotic League, the National Progress Party believes that the government should focus on individual freedom and personal responsibility. Members of this party feel that the best way to achieve progress is through a strong free market economy, and that government interference in that economy should be limited. They are committed to social progress and increased access to education and healthcare, though members of the party disagree on the best route to pursue these advancements. The current regional leader of the National Progress Party is a former scholar turned political activist named Nathaniel Lemaire (he/him).
