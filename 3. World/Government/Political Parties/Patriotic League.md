Premier Remedy Mallingson is the regional leader of the Patriotic League, which is a nationalist political party that emphasizes love of country and loyalty to Hale above all else. Members of this party believe that national identity should take priority over individual interests, and they showcase this belief by supporting policies that protect the ruins of Oldfaire. They also believe that a strong government must involve itself in the daily lives of its citizens in order to ensure safety, security, and economic growth. Mallingson is in her final term in office, and there is a considerable amount of infighting to choose the next Patriotic League Premier candidate.
