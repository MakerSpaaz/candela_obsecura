There are two leading political parties in the Fairelands, each vying for control of the office of the Premier and the majority within the Regional Chamber: the Patriotic League and the National Progress Party. In the years following the Last Great War, with no foreign enemy to unite against, the political landscape is marked by increased antagonism and polarization.

ON SYSTEMS OF POWER 
The systems of power within the Fairelands are designed to provide a scaffolding for the corruption that has long been a facet of the horror genre. This is especially evident in the Criminal specialty. This character type is the foundation of a person who, for one reason or another, finds themselves on the wrong side of an unjust policing system. Making the Criminal a playable member of a Candela Obscura circle establishes that the official law of the land is not a representation of morality. While individuals and institutions can be worthy adversaries just as much as any monster, both players and the GM have the ability to modify any part of the game to suit their needs and affect the story they wish to tell. Candela Obscuraâ€™s fight against the corruption of supernatural forces is an allegory for the fight of good, everyday people against the corruption of the world. When you play within Hale, craft both a hero and a world that best supports the monsters you wish to defeat.
