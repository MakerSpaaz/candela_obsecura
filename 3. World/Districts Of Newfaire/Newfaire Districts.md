Newfaire is the capital city of the Fairelands, accounting for about 40% of the population of the valley. Due to its position on the coast, this metropolis is a prominent trade and travel hub, with a bustling economy and diverse population. 

The city itself is on a slight slope toward the Glass Sea, with the southernmost districts, such as Nine Irons and the Steel, residing at higher elevations than northern districts, like Hallowharbor and Groundswell. This gradation results in more integration with Oldfaire as the city approaches the ocean. To account for this varied geography, as well as the presence of the ancient city, Newfaire is covered in hilly streets, wide stairways, and arched bridges. 

The majority of the buildings of Newfaire highlight the organic style of Art Nouveau, with the look present in the most extravagant shops, mansions, and political buildings, as well as middle-class homes and humble stores. The restoration following the post-war bombings has shifted construction sensibilities to the more angular design of Art Decoâ€”a style that the new titans of industry and electricity are keen to adopt.
