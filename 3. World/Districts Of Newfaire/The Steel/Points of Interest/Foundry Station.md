The railroad stop in the [[The Steel]] where raw materials from the region come into Newfaire, and products are sent out. During the war, the city’s factories created weapons that went immediately to the front lines of the Haven Hills and what is now [[Westwreck]]. Now, this acts as EONS’s primary hub for importing and exporting inventions.
