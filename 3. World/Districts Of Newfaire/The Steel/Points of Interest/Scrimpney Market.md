The local market for industrial parts, strange inventions, and items that “fell off the cart,” Scrimpney is a place for wheelers and dealers, con artists, and innovators on the cusp of grand invention. On the surface-level streets is an assemblage of stalls and stores, with workers and impoverished scientists living overhead in the intersecting metal framework the Steel is famous for. Though navigating the market is hazardous due to its industrial structure, the general atmosphere of the place is one of integrity and fairness—the people who live and work in this area protect their own.
