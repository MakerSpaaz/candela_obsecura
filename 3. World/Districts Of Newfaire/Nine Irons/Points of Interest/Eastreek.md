The impoverished shantytown on the outskirts of Newfaire that’s built alongside the landfill of the same name. Here, one man’s trash is another man’s home. Its citizens don’t have electric power, causing the area to flicker with candlelight each night. What possessions they do have are regularly destroyed by Periphery raids that come with little to no warning.!
