A gaudy tourist trap where people live out re-enactments of life in Oldfaire. Though some elements of the park are kitschy, it’s considered by anthropologists to be fairly accurate in its historical representations. The “Park after Dark” haunted tours are famous, and there are numerous tales of real bodies rising from the ancient graves.
