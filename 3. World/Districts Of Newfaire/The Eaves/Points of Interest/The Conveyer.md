There are only three routes up to the Eaves: the ancient, ramped stairway known as the High Steps, covertly scaling the ruins of Oldfaire, or the Conveyor. The Conveyor is a massive platform guarded and controlled by the Periphery, and the majority of those who live, work, or deliver to the Eaves use this route. Visitors must have special papers or a neighborhood pass to use the lift.
