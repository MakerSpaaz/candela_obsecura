This district is the home of the Ascendancy within the Fairelands, where religious figures
and zealous Ascendants have established their homes to live alongside the Church. The
Shriveline features elevated bridges crossing over bustling streets, connecting houses of
worship, cemeteries, parks, and charitable institutions. The residential homes in this district
are primarily owned and rented out by the Ascendancy, providing a massive source of taxless
revenue for the Church.

Though most buildings here are older and display Gothic architectural design, many of the
interiors of the Ascendancyâ€™s most prestigious churches are renovated with an Art Nouveau
sensibility. Some members of the church are working to bring the church into the new
century, but the Cardinal of the Fairelands is a staunch advocate of tradition.
