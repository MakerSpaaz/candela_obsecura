This cemetery is filled with new burials and graves so old there are no longer markers to denote them. There was an influx of internments during the war, requiring groundskeepers to dig up and dispose of a vast number of unattributed corpses. The wooden fences around this burial ground are covered in straight pins, hat pins, and needles.
