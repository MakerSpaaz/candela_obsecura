This network of catacombs snakes through the upper layers of Oldfaire ruins, forming a maze of hideaways that Pyre uses for many of their secret rituals. Filled with graves, smuggling caches, and illicit meeting places, the catacombs are as haunted by occultists as they are by the spirits of the undead.
