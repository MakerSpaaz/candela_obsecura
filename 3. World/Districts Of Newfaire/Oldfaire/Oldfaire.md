Beneath the city of Newfaire lies the mysterious ruins of Oldfaireâ€”a place that was once a thriving civilization, but suffered a catastrophic collapse around 2,000 years ago. Perfectly positioned within the safety of [[Hallowharbor]] and protected by the treacherous Bridleborne Mountains, Oldfaire operated with relative impunity in the ancient world. Led over time by empresses and emperors as well as a council of powerful alchemists, the entire city attempted to utilize [[Magick]] in the way Newfaire now uses electricity.

The ancient city was built around a central towervault, the Ziggurat, where the government of Oldfaire attempted to house and utilize magickal phenomena. But the alchemists were ill-equipped to manage bleed, and the citizens were affected by the horrors that come from prolonged exposure to the corrupting energy.

Halen lore suggests that human minds and bodies transformed and society collapsed. The once powerful city of stone fell when a local thinning was torn asunder. It was this cataclysmic event that tore a rift in the sea, known as the Vastchasam. From this seismic shift, a wall of water swept forth and first drowned, then buried Oldfaire, wiping its technology from the
face of the world.

Today, beneath the modern metropolis of Newfaire, within the tombs of its predecessor, magickal monsters, alchemical discoveries, and mutated Oldfairen citizens still lurk.
