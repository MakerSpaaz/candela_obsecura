The most verdant district in the city, Briar Green, surrounds the local hub of academia, Briarbank College. Home to the majority of the city’s parks, it’s filled with flowering trees, gardens, and affluent homes. Many politicians consider “the Green” a pinnacle of Newfairen ideals—delivering long speeches about the way the academia, architecture, and open space act as a testament to the values of the people of the Fairelands. 

Though Briarbank College attracts a young crowd to the area, the population of the school accounts for only a portion of the area’s occupants. Many graduates who receive academic or artistic grants choose to live “on the green,” and more than a few wealthy families have palatial homes and luxury townhouses that overlook the Splendid Reach—the largest park in the district.![[background3.jpg]]
