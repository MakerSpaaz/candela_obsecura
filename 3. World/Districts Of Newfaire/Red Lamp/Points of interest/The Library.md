A loud burlesque club and casino with the tagline “Come In and Check
Out.” Famous for its large size and maze-like rooms, their stages display all manner of
performances, including “Banned & Censored,” “Critical Lit,” and “There’s the Rub.” During
the day, the Library runs a coffee shop known for attracting artists.
