Named for the address above the entrance door, this warehouse is used to
hold imported scarlet. It’s famously controlled by the Red Hand, and they’re known to host
incredibly exclusive parties on the upper floors of the building. Some say so much scarlet is
drunk, smoked, and snorted in the facility that the walls are tinted red—a popular story also
used to account for the entire district’s name.
