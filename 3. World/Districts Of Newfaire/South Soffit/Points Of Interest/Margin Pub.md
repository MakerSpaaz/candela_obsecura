One of the most popular pubs in South Soffit, the Margin offers unexpected fare. It has a shockingly affordable selection of wine (on top of the usual beer and hard liquor) and attracts visitors from all over the city. The owner, [[Kailey Zhang]] (she/they), also runs a library of banned books out of the back of the bar.
