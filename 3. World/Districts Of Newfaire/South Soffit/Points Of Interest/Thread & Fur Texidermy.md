This taxidermy shop can’t get a storefront in any other district, and the owner has certainly tried. Perhaps it’s the unblinking faces of hundreds of animals perched in the windows, the smell of singed fur and iron-rich blood, or the way that Professor Oliver Berrada (he/him) is often inside, insisting he has the body of a real Krakidon for the shop to buy.
