The lower-class district built into the Oldfairen ruins beneath the Eaves. The electric wires that feed the district above run haphazardly through South Soffit, making it a dangerous place to live and work. Those that live in “the Soffit” often work in the homes of the wealthy Newfairens above.

The district is built in layers, with the bottom level providing homes for those who are the most well-off. Here, the houses and roads are safely located on the ground floor, the rest of the city is easily accessible, and the air is cleanest. The topmost levels are the hardest to maintain—and the most dangerous. Residents must navigate the unrailed walkways and
dodge the open electric wires crackling overhead, all while suffering severe smoke pollution from the homes below. The upper Soffit is no place for the faint of heart or the clumsy of foot.
