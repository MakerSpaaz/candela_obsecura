Home to up-and-coming residential neighborhoods and family-operated shops, this district is the middle-class sprawl of Newfaire. Newly installed electric lights illuminate streets, affording the Sidle a reputation for being incredibly safe at night. This area of the city was nearest to the fighting of the Last Great War in Westwreck, but post-victory it was revitalized
into the modern residential landscape it is today.

Most neighborhoods are under constant development, with construction now pushing further and further west. Though the wealth that comes from the incredible population devastation of a hard-won war is most apparent in the middle-class expansion of the Sidle, there is a darkness and a great mourning that comes from success built in the wake of death.
