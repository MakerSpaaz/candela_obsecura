One of the larger thoroughfares that runs through the Sidle. This street has lanes for cars as well as a cable car line. The Department of Transportation canâ€™t figure out why the pavement along Temper Blvd. continues to shift and crack, making portions of the road impassable. Locals describe small earthquakes that rumble in the night, but no scientists have been able to verify these claims.
