In early 1816, this asylum was constructed outside the boundaries of Newfaire so that wealthy citizens could hide away relatives suffering from mental illness—or those who were in fine health but embarrassing the family. The OUP also uses the facility to silence officers and civilians who have suffered from too much bleed, creating the moniker “going gray.” It’s a notoriously horrific and deadly place to live. Those who are sent to Grayslate are rarely released—and if so, are certainly changed.
