Regarded as the gate to the entire region, Hallowharbor’s docks serve as a representation of the hard workers of the region. They are controlled by [[Grint Barrows]] (they/ them), a harbormaster with an iron fist who’s known for taking bribes, though their rate is high and ever-climbing. The dry docks of Newfaire are famous for exceptional ship repair, though numerous laborers have died in industrial accidents.
