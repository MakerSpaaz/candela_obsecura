After the Last Great War, Hale has maintained its military infrastructure, if to a lesser degree. Here, the Halen Armed Forces care for naval vessels, positioned to defend the coast at a moment’s notice. This has also become a popular party location—the Primacy charges exorbitant sums to rent out the ships to “raise money for the defense of the Fairelands.”
