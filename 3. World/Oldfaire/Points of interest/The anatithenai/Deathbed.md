Deep inside the Anatithenai lies a black sarcophagus carved from a single stone. No one has been able to move or open it (though many have tried), and there doesnâ€™t appear to be a lid. Some historians believe this is the final resting place of [[Empress Iomene]]. Others cite recently uncovered ancient texts that describe her body going missing, with no funeral rites performed.
