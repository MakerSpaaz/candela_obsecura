Scholars believe that this site was built on the outskirts of Oldfaire to keep future residents of the land away. Ancient records suggest they constructed this monument just before the fall of the city, hoping to warn away anyone who came after them. Few who have entered the site have ever returned, and skeletons lie like breadcrumbs around the spiked mouth of the cave. The words over the entrance translate to “When one enters, all are cursed.”
