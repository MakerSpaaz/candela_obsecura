No members of the original team hired to dig at this location are known to have survived. Most of their bodies remain at the site, bound with rope in a shape that suggests some sort of ritual was performed. The bodies were visibly exsanguinated, and each skeletonâ€™s jaw was snapped open while they were still alive.
