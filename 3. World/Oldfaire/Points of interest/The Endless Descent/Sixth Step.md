Also called the Hive, the vertical wall of this stair is patterned like the honeycombs of bees. Those who look closely inside each hexagon can see miniature buildings that arenâ€™t in the classic Oldfairen style. No one is certain what lives in each dwelling, though various parties attempting to make the descent complained about hearing voices in the night while camping on the sixth step.
