  - seventy second step

This step is sometimes referred to as the First Landing. Itâ€™s six times larger than any other mapped stair, and was originally thought to be the bottom of the staircase. Growing as healthily as if they were underneath the summer sun, an entire forest
flourishes within the bounds of step 72. Those who enter seem to be in a moonlit portion of the Scarlet Wood.
