On this stair lie the remnants of a large archeological encampment. The front of each tent is still tied shut, though each bears slash marks through the sides. Items such as lanterns, coats, and food are strewn about, but there are no bodies here. On close inspection, a set of six bullets are embedded in the stone wall of the previous stair, and it appears that the intended target was at least double the height of a person.
