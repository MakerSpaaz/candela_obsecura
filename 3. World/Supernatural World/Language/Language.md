Many of the words found within this text are English translations of the Halen language.
This is particularly apparent in the names of places. You’ll notice that many regions and
districts are called exactly what they are—for example, Westwreck is the land to the west of
Newfaire that was ravaged during the Last Great War. Because the Fairelands were conquered
so often and remain so diversely populated, over time, Halen citizens found it easier to speak
frankly. Simpler names ease translation in cities filled with speakers of diverse languages. To
some, the directness of Halen speech is considered rude, while others find it trustworthy.
Within the archeological community of the Fairelands, and particularly among the
Lightkeepers of Candela Obscura, Ancient Fairen is both studied and utilized in
communications. This alphabetic language translates fairly easily into modern Halen, and
is a foundational part of spellwork. The ancient alchemists of Oldfaire developed a specific
system for channeling magick through writing by combining their language with charts,
figures, and alchemical symbols to create works known as “sigils.” This process cannot
mitigate bleed, and to say that it controls magick would be a gross misrepresentation, but the
careful scholar of the occult would do well to learn to read and write in Ancient Fairen.
