Investigators within Candela Obscura use the term phenomena to describe any and all mysterious occurrences. This could include a terrifying flying beast, a lake of seaweed that drowns victims, blood raining from the sky, a wardrobe that transfers human consciousness between bodies, or even a spirit trapped within a music box. Remember, the myths of the Fairelands can be very similar to the fables and eerie tales from your world. With respect for various cultures and closed practices, you can use familiar lore to create entities that best facilitate the tales you wish to tell.
